# The O'Reilly Animals

O'Reilly Media made a page of their cover and cover animals, so I
scraped it and turned it into JSON. No big whoop. I wrote about it
on Perl.com in [Extracting the list of O'Reilly Animals](https://www.perl.com/article/extracting-the-list-of-o-reilly-animals/).
There was a [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25915216) too.
